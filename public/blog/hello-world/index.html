  <p><i>January 30, 2026, 1 min read</i></p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to publish a personal website for as long as I remember, and finally it&rsquo;s here.</p>
<ul>
<li>This website was built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</li>
<li>I am hosting it using Github Pages, you can find the source code <a href="link">here</a>.</li>
<li>I purchased the domain from</li>
<li>My favicon is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seals_in_the_Sinosphere">seal/stamp</a> of my Chinese name (lit. &ldquo;Seal of Derek Li&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
<p>This time I wanted to build the overall aesthetic and functionality up myself rather than use something others had already built. I tried Quartz because I like the idea of Obsidian as a notetaking app but it felt almost too powerful. I&rsquo;ve also tried straight up HTML/CSS templates (back in the day), but there&rsquo;s something really special about choosing your own creative direction, implementing ideas you personally want, and learning in the process. Carving out a little piece of the internet as a form of self-expression I suppose.</p>
<p>Yes, I do still need to add quite a bit of desired functionality. I think the aesthetics are close to what I was targeting, but also might make changes. At the very least, I thought it was good enough to publish.</p>
<p>Indeed, progress is better than perfection.</p>
