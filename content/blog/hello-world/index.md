I've been wanting to publish a personal website for as long as I remember, and finally it's here.

- This website was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- I am hosting it using Github Pages, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/dliGH/dliGH.github.io).
- I purchased the domain from [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/).
- My favicon is a [seal/stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seals_in_the_Sinosphere) of my Chinese name (lit. "Seal of Derek Li").

This time I wanted to build the overall aesthetic and functionality up myself rather than use something others had already built. I tried [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) because I like the idea of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a notetaking app but it felt almost too powerful. I've also tried straight up HTML/CSS templates (back in the day), but there's something really special about choosing your own creative direction, implementing ideas you personally want, and learning in the process. Carving out a little piece of the internet as a form of self-expression I suppose.

Yes, I do still need to add quite a bit of desired functionality. I think the aesthetics are close to what I was targeting, but also might make changes. At the very least, I thought it was good enough to publish.

Indeed, progress is better than perfection.
